# sdseml_online_exercises
Online exercise classes for the course "Social Data Science: Econometrics and Machine Learning"
Course material can be found at [the main repo](https://github.com/abjer/sds_eml_2020/).

## General information
As of march 11th UCPH is recommends moving courses online to reduce exposure to coronavirus. In line with this recommendation we are moving the exercise classes of SDSEML online. ~~The last in-class exercise will take place on March 13. Note that (for now) this is only a recommendation; other courses you follow might continue with in-class teaching. Since our exercises are relatively well suited for online teaching we have chosen to adapt the recommendation quickly.~~ News move faster than we could have thought. Starting tomorrow all of your activites at the university should be cancelled or moved online.

## Online exercises
We will try to keep as much of the structure of the in-class exercises as possible. Thus you will still see a new exercise set and a new "quick warmup" every week. However there will be some changes, which are outlined below.

### Handing in
Instead of in-class feedback you must "hand in" your progress on the previous exercise sets as we go. There are no requirements about completing the exercises, but the material you hand in should reflect that you have spend some time attempting to solve the problems. 

To hand in you need a (group) folder in this repository. ~~I will help you with setting up these folders in the final classroom sessions. If you don't either of these sessions~~. Here is a short guide (more detailed instructions are readily available online):
  * Fork this repository.
  * Clone your fork to your PC.
  * Create your (group) folder and add any material you would like.
  * Push your changes to your fork.
  * Create a pull request, requesting to pull the changes from your fork into this repository.
 
To hand in, push your solutions to your (groups) folder in this repository. Your answers to the exercises can be handed in as a jupyter notebook, while the "quick warmup" should be supplied as a .py file. 

In the repo you will already see an example of how to structure your (groups) folder. I have pushed my solutions to exercise 4, and created a folder for exercise 5 in my folder "TA_EXAMPLE_FOLDER".

_Note:_ if you prefer not to use your real name for your folder, you can pick any other name for it, and send Kristian an email stating which folder you have created.

#### Working in groups
You are allowed to complete the exercises in groups of any size. If you work in a group you only need to submit one solution set. Please send Kristian an email saying what your group name is, and who are the members.

_Note:_ the purpose of moving the exercises online is to reduce face-to-face contact between students. Thus we also recommend that you carry out your group work online, to the extend possible.

## Dates
* Hand in your progress on exercise set 5 and the quick warmup (20/3/2020).

## Q/A
**Where will the exercises be posted?**
Exercises are posted still posted in [the main repo](https://github.com/abjer/sds_eml_2020/). 

**When are the exercises posted?**
We will try to implement a fixed schedule for releasing exercises, but to begin with the time they are posted will be varying. If you are wondering why an exercise set still haven't been posted, send Kristian an email.

**When will in-class exercises resume?** We don't know, but would not be surprised if we have to run exercises online for the remainder of the semester.
